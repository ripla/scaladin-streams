# Scaladin Stream Extensions

This is an experimental project that aims to enhance 
[Scaladin](https://github.com/henrikerola/scaladin) with support for
[Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/). The API should be 
compatible with the specification, while demoing the features with Akka Streams.
